Thank you for taking the time to contribute to **zaprpc**! ⚡

This document contains all the information to help you get started!

## Setup ⚙️

Please refer to the setup instructions provided in [README.md](README.md) to set up the project locally.

## Commit Guidelines

Follow [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) messages to keep history clean.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Each pull request should focus on **a single, clear purpose** — a feature, fix, refactor, or documentation update. Avoid combining unrelated changes in one PR.
- Before opening a PR, ensure your code is **well formatted and all local checks pass**:
  
  ```bash
  go fmt
  go vet
  ```
- **Do not** deviate from the Pull Request format.

## Opening an Issue

When opening an issue, please include enough detail to help others reproduce or understand the problem.

### For bugs:

- Steps to reproduce

- Expected vs. actual behavior

- Environment details (OS, Go version etc.)

- Screenshots or logs, if available

### For feature requests:

- The problem or use case it solves

- A clear and concise description of the proposed feature

- Any relevant mockups, examples, or references

### For chores or maintenance:

- Describe the task and its purpose

- Mention any dependencies or related PRs

- Before opening a new issue, please check if it already exists.

## DON'Ts

- **Do not** push directly to the main branch.
- **Do not** submit multiple unrelated changes in one PR.
- **Do not** deviate from the Pull Request format.
- **Do not** commit build artifacts.
- **Do not** use vague commit messages like “fix stuff” or “update things.”
- **Do not** modify dependency versions without a clear reason.
